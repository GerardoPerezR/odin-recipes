<p>Rhodomel is a bla bla bla</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>

<li>1 kilogram of honey</li>
<li>1 pint of loosely packed Rose petals</li>

</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<p>Add the honey and rose petals/hips to your fermenter, then fill with water up to half way. Shake the fermenter vigorously to dissolve the honey and aerate the must. Add water to fill most of the way, leaving some headspace in case it foams up. Add the yeast of your choice, and shake to incorporate. Finally, install an airlock, and store in a cool, dark place.

    Once fermentation is complete, rack into another vessel for batch conditioning (also called secondary fermentation) or directly bottle.</p>
